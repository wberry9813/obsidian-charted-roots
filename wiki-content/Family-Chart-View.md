# Family Chart View

The Interactive Family Chart View is a persistent, interactive visualization panel for exploring and editing family trees in real-time. Unlike the static canvas exports, it provides a dynamic, explorable interface powered by the [family-chart](https://github.com/donatso/family-chart) library.

## Scope: People and Person-to-Person Relationships Only

The Family Chart is intentionally a **person-only graph**. Its job is to answer questions such as “who is related to whom?”, “how?”, and “what did that person-to-person relationship look like at a given time?”

**Nodes are always person notes.** Event, Source, Citation, Place, Organization, Office, Claim, Period, Process, Universe, and other entity types do **not** become Family Chart cards.

Those entities still enrich the people shown in the chart:

- Sources can drive source indicators, research coverage, and person details.
- Events can contribute dates, marriages, life-history context, and timeline information.
- Places can appear in person details and geographic views.
- Organizations and offices belong in Entity Profile / Organization views and temporal research views.
- Claims, citations, and assertions belong in the evidence/research layer.

For broader heterogeneous knowledge graphs, use Obsidian Graph View, Canvas, Entity Profile, Timeline, Map, and the dedicated research/source views.

Custom relationship overlays follow the same boundary: an overlay line is drawn **only when both endpoints are people already visible as cards in the current Family Chart**. A person-to-organization or person-to-event relation never introduces a non-person card.

## Opening the Family Chart

**Method 1: Command palette**
1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P`
2. Type "Charted Roots: Open family chart"
3. Select a root person when prompted
4. The chart opens in a new view

**Method 2: From a person note**
1. Open a person note (must have `cr_id` property)
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P`
3. Type "Charted Roots: Open current note in family chart"
4. The chart opens centered on that person

## Navigation and Exploration

### Pan and Zoom

- **Mouse wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Click and drag**: Pan around the chart
- **Zoom buttons**: Fine-grained zoom control in the toolbar
- **Fit to view**: Reset view to show entire tree

### Click Interactions

- **Single click** on a person card: Center the view on that person
- **Double click** on a person card: Open their note in the editor

## Display Options

### Person Card Avatars

If a person note has a `media` property, the first media item is displayed as a thumbnail avatar on their card. This works with:
- Photos linked via `media: "[[portrait.jpg]]"`
- The first item in a media array: `media: ["[[portrait.jpg]]", "[[other.jpg]]"]`
- Media linked during Gramps Package (`.gpkg`) import

Use the `charted-roots-media` block with `editable: true` in person notes to drag-and-reorder media items—the first item becomes the thumbnail.

### Color Schemes

Access via the color scheme dropdown in the toolbar:
- **Gender**: Pink for female, blue for male (traditional genealogy colors)
- **Generation**: Different colors for each generation level
- **Collection**: Color by collection membership
- **Monochrome**: Neutral coloring for clean appearance

### Layout Spacing

Access via the layout settings button (gear icon). Horizontal (node) spacing controls the distance between sibling cards:

- **Tight**: 140px (matches the Mini card style)
- **Compact**: 200px (matches the Compact card style)
- **Normal**: 250px (matches the Rectangle card style, default)
- **Spacious**: 350px (maximum readability)

Switching card style automatically picks a matching default spacing. If you pick a preset that would be smaller than the current card style's minimum, spacing is clamped to prevent cards from overlapping — switch to a smaller card style first for a genuinely tighter tree.

### Card Field Toggles

The display settings menu (eye icon in the toolbar) controls which person fields appear on each in-tree card. Cards grow vertically to fit whatever you enable:

- **Show birth dates** / **Show death dates** — from the `born` / `died` properties
- **Split given/surname** — renders name on two lines instead of one
- **Show nickname** — from the `nickname` property
- **Show title** — from the `title` property (nobility, honorific, rank)
- **Show pronouns** — from the `pronouns` property
- **Show occupation** — from the `occupation` property
- **Show religion** — from the `religion` property
- **Show caste** — from the `caste` property

Toggles persist across Obsidian restarts. Turning on a field for which some people have no value will show a blank line on those cards; turn the toggle off to tighten the layout again.

### Sort Options

The display settings menu also controls the left-to-right order of children and spouses within a family unit:

- **Sort children by birth date** — children render oldest-first (left) to youngest (right). Children without a birth date fall to the end. The sort uses a universe-aware canonical-year comparison (so fictional eras like BBY, EF, DE order chronologically rather than alphabetically). When two siblings share the same canonical year, the raw `born` field is compared lexically — this catches month / day differences within a year, and for twins or triplets recorded with an ISO 8601 time component (`born: 1985-04-12T03:42`), the time tiebreaks the order deterministically. Final fallback when birth date strings match exactly is frontmatter insertion order. The same sort behavior applies to the Profile View Children section, the Canvas Family Tree, the dynamic Relationship Block, and report surfaces (Family Group Sheet, Register, Descendant Chart, etc.).
- **Sort spouses by marriage date** — spouses render first-married (left) to most-recently-married (right). Useful for serial remarriages or polygamous families where the frontmatter order doesn't reflect chronology. Spouses without a marriage date fall to the end. Marriage dates come from the spouse-relationship metadata (e.g. `spouse1_marriage_date`).

Both toggles are off by default (frontmatter order is used).

### As-of Date Filter

Show the family as it existed on a specific date. Useful for both genealogy ("what did my family look like in 1870?") and worldbuilding (tracking character states through a timeline).

To use it, set a date in the **Time** group on the toolbar (native date picker). The chart updates to reflect that moment in time:

- **People born after the selected date** are hidden, so the tree shows only people who existed by then.
- **People who died before the selected date** stay visible but are rendered with a dashed border and reduced opacity, so the family structure remains intact and you can see ancestry at a glance.
- **Marriage lines** are shown only when the marriage was active on the selected date (after the marriage date and before any divorce date). A person's multiple marriages appear or disappear depending on which were current.

Click the **X** button next to the date field to clear the filter. The selected date persists across Obsidian restarts.

**Date handling notes:**

- Exact ISO dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) are compared at day-level precision.
- Approximate dates (`ABT 1850`, `BEF 1900`, etc.) fall back to year-level comparison — appropriate for genealogy data where day precision usually isn't known.
- Custom non-family relationships (liege/vassal, ally/rival, etc.) are not filtered by date yet — support for that lands alongside [#386](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/386).

### Focus Indicator

The focus (root) person's card is marked with an outline so you can pick it out in a large tree. The outline uses your Obsidian accent colour (Settings > Appearance > Accent color) rather than the card's text colour, so it stays clearly visible on every card style and in both light and dark themes, and it carries through to chart exports. To change its colour, change your accent colour. To adjust its width (2-10px, default 4px), use the [Style Settings plugin](Styling-And-Theming#family-chart-view) and set **Family Chart View → Focus outline width**.

### Kinship Labels

Toggle relationship labels on connecting lines to show how people are related:

1. Open the **Layout** menu (gear icon in toolbar)
2. Enable **Show kinship labels**
3. Links now display "Parent" or "Spouse" labels

This helps clarify relationship types at a glance, especially useful when presenting or reviewing complex family structures.

### Custom Relationships Overlay

Render non-family custom relationships (liege/vassal, ally/rival, mentor/disciple, godparent, and other custom types) as styled overlay lines on top of the tree.

**Enabling:**

1. First, enable the **Family chart overlay** toggle on the relationship types you want visible — Control Center → Relationships → edit a type → "Render on family chart as overlay line" (see [Custom Relationships](Custom-Relationships#family-chart-overlay))
2. In the Family Chart **Display** menu, toggle **Show custom relationships** on
3. When multiple overlay-enabled types exist, each gets its own per-type toggle indented under the master toggle

**Rendering behavior:**

- Non-family overlays (ally, mentor, sire, liege, etc.) render as curves that arc below the chord between the two cards, visually distinct from the tree's structural links.
- Adopted / step / foster overlays restyle the existing parent-child line with the overlay's color and dash pattern when that link is visible — no separate line is drawn. When the structural link isn't in the current view, rendering falls back to the arc.
- Lines use the type's configured color and line style.
- Same-pair multiple arc relationships stack with a perpendicular offset so each stays visible.
- Symmetric types draw one line per pair; asymmetric types draw a directed line.
- The as-of date filter applies — relationships with `from`/`to` date ranges outside the selected date are hidden.
- Hover a line for a tooltip with source, relationship type, target, and date range.
- Overlay arcs paint **on top** of the structural family-link layer in the typical case so they're never hidden by parent-child or spouse lines. When a single endpoint pair has three or more overlay arcs stacked on it, the layer order automatically flips so the structural family link stays visible underneath the stack — preserves the structural-line-visibility guarantee for heavy overlays.

**Visibility constraint:** the overlay augments lines between cards already visible in the current chart — it does not introduce new cards for off-tree relationships. The chart's card set is built from the focal person's bio / adopted / step family graph. If a person has a custom relationship with someone outside that graph (e.g., a Master / Padawan or godparent relationship to a person unrelated by family), neither person's chart will show the line because the chart contains at most one of the two cards. The other person isn't drawn at all. To see the connection, both people need to be reachable via family relationships from the focal person — once both cards are present, the overlay line draws between them.

The overlay is independent of family-tree structure in the sense that *types* can be tree-only (affects layout, no overlay), overlay-only (no layout impact, rendered as an overlay line), or both — but the *rendering* still requires both endpoints to be on the visible tree.

### Highlight Groups

![Highlight Groups in motion: two groups active, matching cards glow while non-matching cards dim](images/cr-family-chart-highlight-groups.gif)

*Two highlight groups active (Collection = blood, Collection = married_in); matching cards glow while non-matching cards dim to 30% opacity.*

Spotlight cards matching a property value while dimming the rest — useful for pattern-finding in large trees (e.g., "who are all the Magicians?", "which people belong to this faction?", "which descendants have the highest research level?").

**Enabling:**

1. In the Family Chart **Display** menu, click **Highlight groups...**
2. In the modal, click **Add group** — configure up to 3 concurrent groups
3. For each group, pick:
   - **Field** — Sex, Occupation, Title, Religion, Caste, Nationality, Universe, or Collection
   - **Value** — exact match (case-insensitive)
   - **Color** — one of 12 palette colors (gold, orange, red, pink, purple, indigo, blue, cyan, teal, green, lime, brown)
4. Toggle **Enabled** per group if you want to keep a group configured but temporarily off
5. Click **Save**

**Rendering behavior:**

- Matching cards render with a **colored glow** in the group's color
- Non-matching cards (when any group is active) dim to **30% opacity**, keeping structure visible
- When a card matches multiple groups, the first group in the list wins for the glow color
- Groups persist across view reloads via the view's state

**Clearing:** Open the modal and click **Clear all**, or delete individual groups.

**Field value matching** is case-insensitive and handles common sex aliases ("male" / "man" / "M" all match the canonical "M"). Built-in fields only in v1; custom property support arrives once [#377](https://github.com/banisterious/obsidian-charted-roots/issues/377) ships.

### Card Styles

Choose from 4 card styles to match your visualization needs. Access via the **Style** menu → **Card Style** submenu.

| Style | Description | Best For |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Rectangle** | 200px-wide cards with avatar thumbnails and full details (name, dates) | General use, detailed views |
| **Circle** | Circular avatar cards with name labels below | Photo-centric trees, visual appeal |
| **Compact** | 180px-wide cards with optional small avatar (35×35) | Large trees, structure focus |
| **Mini** | 120px-wide cards with optional tiny avatar (25×25) | High-level overviews, navigation |

**Features:**
- Card style persists across Obsidian restarts
- Switching card style automatically sets a matching horizontal spacing default (can still be overridden from the layout menu)
- Compact and Mini render a small avatar when the **Show avatars** toggle is enabled; hide them for pure text-only cards
- All styles support the "Open note" button (smaller on Mini)
- All styles work with PNG/PDF export
- Circle style uses circular avatar cropping with gender-colored backgrounds

**Choosing a Style:**
- Use **Rectangle** for most genealogy work where you want to see photos and dates
- Use **Circle** for presentations or when photos are the main focus
- Use **Compact** when working with large trees (50+ people) to see more at once
- Use **Mini** for quick navigation or getting an overview before zooming in

- "Reset to defaults" clears in-view settings, revealing Style Settings values
- Both can coexist—use in-view for quick switching, Style Settings for vault-wide defaults

## State Persistence

The Family Chart View automatically saves and restores:
- Root person selection
- Color scheme preference
- Card style preference
- Edit mode state
- Layout spacing settings
- Date visibility preference
- Approximate zoom level

When you close and reopen a family chart, it returns to the same state.

## Multiple Chart Views

Open additional family chart tabs to compare different branches or root persons:

### Open a New Chart

1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P`
2. Type "Charted Roots: Open new family chart"
3. Select a root person
4. A new chart tab opens alongside existing ones

### Duplicate Current Chart

1. Click the three-dot menu (⋮) on the chart tab
2. Select **Duplicate view**
3. A copy of the current chart opens in a new tab

This allows you to:
- Compare different branches side-by-side
- Keep one view on ancestors while exploring descendants in another
- Navigate to different people without losing your current position
